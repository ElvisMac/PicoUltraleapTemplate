# PicoUltraleapTemplate
Base template for creating Pico 3 hand tracking projects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base template for creating Pico 3 (or Pico 4, but untested) projects.  This includes
Headset tracking working fine with builds deployed to the headset as well as the Ultraleap
integration which provides hand tracking using one of the HMD mounted devices.

Only point of note when cloning this repo is that the SDK for the Pico may not be found.
I left my SDK on my computer in the D:\ drive:

    D:\SDKs\PICO Unity OpenXR SDK-Preview-110

This is where the package.json should be when you download the SDK yourself from here:

    https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/resources/#sdk

I used the PICO Unity OpenXR SDK（Preview）v1.1.0 located as the last download on their SDK 
downloads page.
